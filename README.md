## JSPlay - A JavaScript Playground

JSPlay is a JavaScript playground that allows you to write and execute JavaScript code in a browser. It is built using Vanilla JavaScript and uses Bootstrap 5 for styling. We build this project based on Dracula Theme. You can find the theme [here](https://draculatheme.com/).
